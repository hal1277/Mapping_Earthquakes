## Overview
The project was to help Basil and Sadhana create an earthquake map using HTML, Javascript, Leaflet, and Mapbox.  

## Results 

A map of earth has been create with three base layers that are user selectable: street, satellite, and dark.  As well there are three overlay layers that are also user selectable.  The layers highlight earthquakes in the last 7 days, the tectonic plates, and major earthquakes (magnitude greater than 4.5) in the last 7 days.  The color and size of the circles represent the magnitude of the earthquake.  And, a pop up box has been linked to each circle so that users can see the location and magnitude of the earthquake.
